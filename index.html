          <p id="para1">I am a 23-year-old with a passion for video gaming, reading, tabletop gaming and more...
            I am currently holding a position as a bartender whilst I search for a start to my career as a full-stack
            developer. </p>
          <p>I successfully completed the Bronze Duke of Edinburgh Award in 2014 and took part in various outdoor
            survival
            courses. I used to be an active member of the Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Explorer Scouts and used my scouting
            skills to
            take hikes or to camp outdoors,
            and to generally feel superior compared to any casual campers out there.</p>
          <p>During my time at university, I spent a couple of months as a cadet in the Sheffield University Officer
            Training Corps.
            Whilst there, I took part in training exercises involving live firearms, field tactis and leadership skills.
          </p>
          <p>I used to be the prefect for computer science at my sixth-form, helping department staff out on induction
            days
            and open evenings by showing my knowledge in the field to any visitors.</p>
